## About Rhythm

We are a team of musicians and producers who are familiar with IT knowledge. Ever since the covid pandemic, many of our talented artists have difficulties travelling to us just to make a booking and the dramatic increase of the telephone bills for the calls as well. We want to overcome this problem by building a website where users can subscribe to the membership and vip membership plans. In addition, we will make it possible for them to choose their date to book for their desired day which they can pay for it through online payment method for both cards and paypal.
